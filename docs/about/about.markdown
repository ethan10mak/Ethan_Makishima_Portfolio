My name is Ethan, and I am a second-year master's student at the University of California, Santa Cruz, pursuing a degree in Computer Science and Engineering. I only have one quarter of school left and will complete my degree by December of 2025. As I am finishing up soon, I am exploring my options in the job market, and am interested in Autonomous Vehicles, Robotics, and AI/ML.

I have been working at UC Santa Cruz on [Scenic][scenic], a probabilistic programming language designed for testing autonomous systems, such as self-driving cars. I have been working on a major extension of Scenic implementing a Python backend to produce three-dimensional meshes for [OpenDrive][opendrive] road networks and have also started to test using [CARLA][carla], an open-source driving simulator run on [Unreal Engine][unreal].

This portfolio was created using Github Pages and [jekyll][jekyll-organization]

The portfolio is currently still being with projects I am working on, as well as previous projects I have done.
