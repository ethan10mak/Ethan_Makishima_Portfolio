My name is Ethan, and I am a second-year master's student at the University of California, Santa Cruz, pursuing a degree in Computer Science and Engineering. I only have one quarter of school left and will complete my degree by December of 2025. As I am finishing up soon, I am exploring my options in the job market, and am interested in Autonomous Vehicles, Robotics, and AI/ML.
